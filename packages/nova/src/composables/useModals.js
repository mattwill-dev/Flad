 *   tasting notes, where beans share individual notes but never the whole
 *   combination — so the suggestions have to be per-note, not per-bean.
 *   suggestions: existing values shown below the input, filtered as you type and
 *   tappable to fill+confirm — how the bean editor keeps roaster/origin/variety/
 *   process spellings consistent instead of re-typing them each time. In tags
 *   mode a tap ADDS the note and keeps the modal open instead of confirming.
