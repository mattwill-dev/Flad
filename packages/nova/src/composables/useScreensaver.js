/**
 * Sleep and lock are two different things: pressing the power button sleeps the
 * DE1 AND locks the screen, but unlocking (tapping the screensaver) does not have
 * to wake the DE1 back up — see nova_wake_on_unlock in SkinPanel. This composable
 * owns `locked` as skin-local UI state (not core: no other skin needs it).
 *
 * `locked` is set ONLY by explicit lock()/unlock() calls (PowerButton.vue is the
 * one caller of lock()) — it does NOT watch NSXCore's 'machineState' event.
 * That event fires on every machine snapshot (~every 250ms) for as long as the
 * DE1 stays asleep, not just on the transition into sleep, and it fires
 * identically whether sleep was triggered by the power button or by the
 * Settings machine-toggle. Locking off of it caused two bugs: the Settings
 * toggle (which must NEVER lock — the whole point is browsing the skin
 * without heating the machine) locked the screen anyway, and unlocking
 * without waking (wakeOnUnlock off) got re-locked by the very next heartbeat.

 * Every request/release call funnels through here, chained onto the previous

 * ISSUED — not the order their network responses happen to land in.
 *
 * Without this, lock()/unlock()/the boot sync/the Settings toggle each fired
 * requestWakeLockOverride()/releaseWakeLockOverride() independently, with no
 * ordering between them. A release fired right after an in-flight request
 * (e.g. unlock's request + a quick re-lock's release, or the boot sync racing
 * an interactive lock()) could have its response land FIRST if the request
 * happened to be the slower round-trip — leaving the gateway's wakelock
 * override actually HELD even though the skin shows the lockscreen and
 * `locked` is true. That's the "screensaver stays on, tablet never times out,
 * only fixed by toggling the Settings switch off and on" bug: toggling it
 * works because that path is `await`ed sequentially — exactly what every
 * other call site was missing.

// This does NOT become a subscription that keeps firing — see the note above
// about why watching 'machineState' continuously is exactly the bug this file
// exists to avoid. First event only, then never touched again.
//
// This is also the ONE place that decides the wakelock's INITIAL state —
// main.js used to unconditionally request it on every boot, racing this
// handler: on a reload into an already-sleeping machine, whichever one ran
// last won, so roughly half the time the boot-time request clobbered the
// release below and the lockscreen kept the display awake forever (keep-awake
// only gets released again on the next explicit lock()). Owning both the
// locked flag AND the wakelock decision in the same handler removes the race.
//
// Brightness needs the identical treatment, and used to not get it: a reload
// only ever set `locked`/the wakelock, never re-pushed the matching
// brightness — so the display just stayed at whatever it physically was
// BEFORE the reload. That's what caused two distinct-looking symptoms from
// the one gap: reloading into an already-sleeping machine could come up
// showing the lockscreen but still bright (never dimmed), and reloading into
// an already-woken one could land on the normal skin but still dim (never
// restored) — reading as "the normal skin's brightness reacts to the
// lockscreen setting." Explicitly (re-)applying brightness in both branches
// here, exactly like lock()/unlock() already do, fixes both at once.
