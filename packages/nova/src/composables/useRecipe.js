/**
 * The current recipe as an editable view over NSXCore's raw "workflow" shape
 * (see packages/core/src/domains/workflow.js's buildGatewayPayload / mapping.js's
 * mapApiWorkflowToDisplay). A recipe = bean + profile (+ grinder, once more than
 * one is configured — see GRINDERS in useGrinders.js).
 *
 * Recipes are real persisted entities the user builds (workflow.js's recipe
 * store: loadRecipes/saveRecipes/makeRecipeId — a gateway-store-backed list,
 * 3-way merged on write), not a list conjured from shot history. `recipe.id`
 * tracks which persisted entity (if any) is currently loaded: set by
 * selectRecipe()/createRecipeFromCurrent(), left null for a workflow the
 * gateway happens to be running that was never loaded through the picker in
 * this session. Editing dose/grind/yield/temp/profile while a recipe.id is
 * set updates that SAME persisted entity (see persistCurrentRecipeEdits,
 * called from pushRecipe) — the same "loaded recipe stays the same recipe"
 * behavior NSX's workflowItems[selectedWorkflowIndex] has.
 *
 * ── The bean / bag invariant ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every workflow that reaches the gateway carries a real bean and a real batch
 * (a *bag*: one bean + one roast date — see bean.js's resolveBatch). That is
 * upheld in exactly one place: ensureRecipeBatch(), called from pushRecipe(),
 * which is the single choke point every workflow passes through. It matters
 * because the batch is the ONLY structural link a shot has back to its bean
 * (shot.workflow.context.beanBatchId -> batch.beanId -> bean); without it the
 * Diary can only guess the bean by roaster/name string matching.
 *
 * Roast date is deliberately NOT a bean field: a bean's roaster/origin/process
 * are permanent, what changes is which bag you're pulling from. It lives on the
 * batch — and a batch's roast date is IMMUTABLE. Setting a new roast date
 * resolves the recipe to a DIFFERENT bag (see setRoastDate); it never rewrites
 * the old one, which would retroactively change the roast date every past shot
 * on that bag reports. The bean itself is managed in the Diary.
